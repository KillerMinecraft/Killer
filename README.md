Killer
======

This is a game mode for Killer Minecraft. See the plugin page for more information: http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/killer 

In Mystery Killer, one player is secretly chosen to attempt to kill the others. No one else is told who it is, and the other players must try to retrieve a blaze rod or ghast tear from the nether, and bring it back to a plinth near the spawn point.

If configured to only assign one killer, the Killer will be given items to help balance the odds, if they're competing against a large number of "friendly" players. Alternatively, the game can be set to allocate multiple killers, to maintain an ideal player ratio.

When you die, you're out until the end of the game. You will be a spectator, and can't communicate with the surviving players. Players won't be told if the player they killed was the Killer, and killing all the Killers won't end the game - in fact, it can be set to allocate new Killers when there are none left.

Mystery Killer works best with at 4-8 players, although the bare minimum is 3 players.
